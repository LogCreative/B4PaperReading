  abstract  = {Private WANs are increasingly important to the operation of enterprises, telecoms,
and cloud providers. For example, B4, Google's private software-defined WAN, is larger
and growing faster than our connectivity to the public Internet. In this paper, we
present the five-year evolution of B4. We describe the techniques we employed to incrementally
move from offering best-effort content-copy services to carrier-grade availability,
while concurrently scaling B4 to accommodate 100x more traffic. Our key challenge
is balancing the tension introduced by hierarchy required for scalability, the partitioning
required for availability, and the capacity asymmetry inherent to the construction
and operation of any large-scale network. We discuss our approach to managing this
tension: i) we design a custom hierarchical network topology for both horizontal and
vertical software scaling, ii) we manage inherent capacity asymmetry in hierarchical
topologies using a novel traffic engineering algorithm without packet encapsulation,
and iii) we re-architect switch forwarding rules via two-stage matching/hashing to
deal with asymmetric network failures at scale.},
